# Note: You must create custom environment variables beginning with REACT_APP_. 
# Any other variables except NODE_ENV will be ignored to avoid accidentally exposing a 
# private key on the machine that could have the same name. Changing any environment 
# variables will require you to restart the development server if it is running.
